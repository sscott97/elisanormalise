ELISA Ratio Normaliser works by turning each sample absorbance into a ratio relative to the mean of the positive controls. So, each absorbance is recalculated by first calculating the mean of the two positive control cells (cell 1 and 2 on the first column - STRICT positioning), then taking the sample absorbance and dividing it by the pos control mean. This gives the final result - a normalized ELISA signal ratio based on the positive control, which is consistent across all plates.
